  CS3201 Coursework P2 : Simpler Reliable Transport Protocol (SRTP).
  saleem, Jan2024, Feb2023.
  checked March 2025 (sjm55)

  API for SRTP.

  Underneath, it MUST use UDP.

  This is a blocking / synchronous API.

  Please read the descriptions of the various API calls below, to understand the
  behaviour of each call.

/*
  Control for retransmissions within the SRTP protocol.

  SRTP_RTO_FIXED:
    re-transmission timeout (RTO), in in microseconds [us].

  SRTP_MAX_RETX:
    the maximum number of re-transmissions to try before assuming that
    transmission is no longer possible, e.g. there is an error, such as a
    network problem.

  srtp_start() is for the server : setting up listen for incoming requests
  only needs to be used once in a program to configure an endpoint on which
  to listen for incoming connection requests.

  - a connection has been established; or
  - there is an error, such as a network problem.

  Arguments:
  : sd is the socket descriptor returned by srtp_start().

  Returns:
  : sd to indicate that the connection has been processed, and so a
    connection now exists (only 1 connection at a time is required).

  Arguments:
  : fqdn is the fully qualified domain name of the remote server (a "dot
    notation" IPv4 address string can also be used).
  : port is the port number to use - you should use getuid()

    by the value of data_size, and is the data that will be transmitted
